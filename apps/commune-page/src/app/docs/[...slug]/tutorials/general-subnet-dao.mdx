# General Subnet Module Curation DAO

The general subnet (s2) operates without a limiting consensus mechanism, allowing flexible weight allocation but requiring protection against abuse. The Module Curation DAO serves this purpose by maintaining an on-chain whitelist of validated module key addresses through a 2/3 majority voting system.

## Purpose and Function

The DAO protects against dishonest weights on junk modules by:
- Evaluating module applications based on clear value propositions
- Maintaining a curated whitelist of approved modules
- Enabling removal of modules that no longer meet standards
- Ensuring only quality modules receive stake-weight allocations

> **Note:** Since the whitelist stores ss58 addresses, modules don't need to reapply after deregistration.

## Module Requirements and Economics

### Whitelist Conditions
- Only whitelisted modules can receive stake-weight allocations
- Whitelisting is required for reward eligibility
- Modules must demonstrate clear value to the Commune ecosystem

### Economic Model
- Modules define stake-weight requirements for access
- Access bandwidth scales with allocated stake
- Rewards increase with stakeholder demand
- Flexible pricing models based on stake-weight

## Application and Registration Process

Modules can join through two pathways in the [Governance Portal][governance]:

1. **S2 Application**
   - `Propose Change → Create new S2 Application`
   - Full DAO review and voting process

2. **Direct Registration**
   - `Propose Change → Register a Module → S2`
   - Must meet pre-established criteria

## Governance Structure

### Decision Making
- 2/3 majority required for all decisions
- Members can initiate removal votes
- Applications undergo collective review and discussion

### Platform Integration
- Primary interface: [Governance Portal][governance]
- Validator interface: [Community Validator Platform][validator]
- Integrated weight management and stakeholder participation tracking

## Future Developments

The system will expand to include:
- API for modules to check stake-weight allocations
- Module idea suggestion platform
- Integration with new human-centric subnets
- Enhanced delegation capabilities for existing validators
