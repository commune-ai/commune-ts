# Deploying a Subnet

First follow the guides at:

- [Building a Subnet](/docs/subnets/building-a-subnet)
- [Subnet Template](/docs/subnets/subnet-template)

## Registering a New Subnet

After you have your full subnet code ready, according to all of the predefined requirements.
Proceed with registering a new subnet storage. 

You can register a new subnet by proceeding with the following command:

```bash
comx subnet register <key-name> <subnet-name>  [--metadata]
```

Note that you will be asked to pay a subnet burn fee, these tokens will be permanently lost.
To determine the cost beforehand, you can query:

```bash
comx subnet params
```

and look for the *subnet_registration_cost* field.

After you registered your subnet, you are still not eligible for an emission distribution.
For **emissions** to start your subnet there will need to be enough consensus weight set on it by rootnet validators.
